You are generating a PlantUML SEQUENCE DIAGRAM for a recipe.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1) Output ONLY a single PlantUML diagram in one code block that starts with @startuml and ends with @enduml. No explanation text.
2) The diagram title must be: "<RECIPE_NAME> - Station Sequence Diagram (Stations as Actors)".
3) Actors are STATIONS (equipment/work areas), not people. Reuse the station list below; add more only if required by the recipe.
4) The recipe must be decomposed into high-level SECTIONS using PlantUML section headers:
   == Section Name ==
5) Immediately under EACH section header, insert TWO notes:
   A) Ingredients note with background color #FFF9E6
   B) Equipment note with background color #E0F7FF
6) Each section’s Ingredients note MUST include:
   - "T: HH:MM:SS" initiation time for the section (the start time of the first step in that section)
   - "Ingredients (with measures):" list with quantities and units for each ingredient referenced in that section
7) Each section’s Equipment note MUST include:
   - "Equipment:" list (station names + any extra equipment like "timer", "ladle", etc.)
8) Each action line MUST be a PlantUML message line in this exact format:
   StationA -> StationB: Action text\nT: t0, t, M:m u, A:a, E:e
   where:
   - t0 = start time of the step (HH:MM:SS), relative to recipe start 00:00:00
   - t  = duration of the step (HH:MM:SS)
   - M  = measured quantity and units (e.g., "500 g pork belly", "2 Tbsp miso", "900 ml stock")
   - A  = optional adverb/adjective for qualitative detail (e.g., "finely", "gently", "until fragrant"); leave blank if none
   - E  = optional equipment notes (e.g., "timer", "lid on", "cast iron optional"); leave blank if none
9) IMPORTANT: Knife and cutting board are NOT separate stations. Use a single station called PrepBoard for all knife/cutting-board work.
10) Use a realistic workflow with parallelizable prep grouped into earlier sections, but keep a single linear sequence in the diagram (no concurrency syntax).
11) Maintain boil/simmer semantics: if timing depends on “returns to boil,” reflect it in step wording and durations.
12) Prefer metric units; include common package measures if given. If the recipe provides US units only, convert approximately to metric AND keep the original in parentheses.
13) If the recipe omits quantities for a topping or optional item, choose sensible defaults for 2 servings (or stated servings) and mark as "optional" where appropriate.
14) Keep station names consistent across the whole diagram. Define participants at top. Include these participants (and add more only if needed):

STATION PARTICIPANTS TO INCLUDE:
participant Refrigerator
participant Pantry
participant PrepBoard
participant Skillet
participant Pot
participant Hob
participant Oven
participant Kettle
participant Bowl
participant Strainer
participant Table

TIMING / STRUCTURE RULES:
- Recipe start is 00:00:00.
- Times should be plausible and consistent (later steps start after earlier ones, unless you explicitly model waiting in duration).
- If the recipe involves long marination, cooling, resting, or chilling, model it as a step with a long duration and the correct stations.

INPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE:
A) SERVINGS: <SERVINGS or "unknown">
B) RECIPE NAME: <RECIPE_NAME>
C) RAW RECIPE TEXT: <PASTE_RECIPE_TEXT_HERE>

YOUR TASK:
- Parse the raw recipe text into stations, sections, steps, ingredients, and equipment.
- Produce the PlantUML diagram meeting all requirements above.
- Preserve the style of the example: action text on first line, the T/M/A/E metadata on the second line using "\n".

Now generate the PlantUML.
